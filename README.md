# Shotgun Roulette

This mod gives you the freedom to shoot yourself with a shotgun.

This is a client-side mod so no one else needs to have the mod installed. Only you need the mod for it to work. However it does support server-side as well which
will allow other players to see you pointing the gun at yourself (not required).

**Features:**
- Shooting yourself
- Rolling the barrel (basically taking a chance on whether you'll die if you shoot)
